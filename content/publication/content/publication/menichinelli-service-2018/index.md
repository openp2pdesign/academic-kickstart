abstract: "This paper explores how the approach, logic and tools of Service Design could support the development of a digital platform that enable the collaborative design of open and collaborative design processes. By integrating Service Design, Activity Theory and Meta-Design, such platform could foster community building and management providing concepts and visualizations that help users in the conscious and reflexive design of the activities constituting their community-based collaborative design processes. How could Service Design enable the meta-design of collaborative design processes on digital platforms? This paper elaborates a proposal for integrating Service Design concepts and tools into a meta-design digital platform for the design and management of collaborative design processes, by providing 1) a reflection on the theoretical connections between Service Design, Activity Theory and Meta-Design, 2) a proposal of a meta-design platform that represents a proof of concept of such connections and 3) a proposal of evaluation strategies for validating such platform."
